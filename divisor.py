# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
div = []
if n < 0: 
    n = -n
    print (n) 
for i in range (1, n+1):
    if (n%i == 0): 
        div.append(i)
print(div)
